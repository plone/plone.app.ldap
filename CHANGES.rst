  will be overwritten from config file - but no interfaces or cache
  settings are changed.

  [kteague]

- Send out notification events for all object additions/modifications/removals
  so that configuration always gets propogated to the LDAPUserFolder object.
  [kteague]

- Changed the base class for LDAPConfiguration so that it gets properly
  rooted in the site (otherwise LDAPConfiguration.__parent__ goes into
  an infinite loop, pointing to a fresh PersistenComponents instance who's
  parent is in turn LDAPConfiguration).
  [kteague]

- Updated the HTML to wrap all control panel forms in a form tag so that
  tabs are properly displayed in Plone 4.
  [kteague]

  the wrong ``__init__.py``.
